This is a recipe management application created using C# in Visual Studio. To use it first you must initilize the database on your machine. To do that run the scripts in the database folder in MySQL, or your preffered database manager. The database was created in MySQL so there is no guarentee that it will work with another database manager.

Now that the database has been set up, you can open the project in Visual Studio and run the program. There is only 1 user in the database at the moment, the username is: "Landon" the password is: "robots".
Once you have logged in you will see a few different recipes already in the database. You can click on them to view the steps and ingredients, or to delete that recipe.
If you go to the add recipe tab you can create new recipes and add steps and ingredients to recipes. You can also edit parts of the recipes that have already been created by double clicking on their list entries in the main page.

TODO:
1. Enable users to add new users.
2. Add integrity checks and warnings when users input incorrect data.
